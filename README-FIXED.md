# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

Week 1 Challenge Activity

## Requirements

This weeks challenge activity tasked us with refactoring a semi-complete website with attached css stylesheet. This is to reflect what could be the assignment of a junior level developer.

## Work Done

All HTML code, stylesheet, and images were all supplied by the MSU Bootcamp gitlab. I went in and cut down on unecessary and duplicated CSS; I renamed multiple div elements to better fit modern accepted HTML syntax; I added alt text to all images; I fixed links on the index page.
